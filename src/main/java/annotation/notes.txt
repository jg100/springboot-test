Auto-wiring

SpringBoot can auto-wire relationships between beans without explicit connection

Auto-wiring modes:
no: Default no auto wiring
byName: Auto-wire by the property name. Looks at the properties of the beans on which
autowire attr is set to byName

byType: Auto-wire by property data type

Constructor: Similar to byType but applies to constructor args.

Autodetect: Spring tries to wire by constructor. If it doesn't work then by type


Can auto-wire by annotations: XML is resolved last and will override any annotations


Annotations achieve the same result as XML configuration
